## Objective
Identify the only human-readable file among a set of binary or non-text files.

## Concepts Learned
- Distinguishing between human-readable text files and binary files
- Using the file command to determine file type
- Filtering and examining multiple files efficiently

## Tools & Commands Introduced
- file – determine file type by content
- Wildcard (*) – operate on multiple files at once
- Output redirection – manage command results

## Approach

2. Use file ./* to inspect the type of each file.
3. Look for the file labeled as "ASCII text" or similar.
4. Display its content.

## Example Command

cat ./the-readable-file

## Key Takeaway
- The file command is essential for understanding unknown file formats.
- Automated inspection (via wildcards) speeds up analysis of multiple files.
