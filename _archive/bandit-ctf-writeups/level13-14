# Bandit Level 13 → Level 14

## Objective
Authenticate via SSH using a provided private key instead of a password.

## Concepts Learned
- SSH key‑based authentication
- Private key file permissions and security (600)
- Connecting to a local SSH service on a non‑standard port

## Tools & Commands Introduced
- ssh -i – specify an identity (private key) file
- chmod 600 – restrict key file access to owner only
- /etc/bandit_pass/ – system location storing level passwords

## Approach
1. Locate the private key file in the home directory.
2. Copy the key to a temporary location and set secure permissions.
3. Use the key to connect to localhost as the next user (bandit14)
4. Retrieve the password for the current level from the standard path.

## Example Command
ssh -i private_key user@host -p port

## Key Takeaway
- Private keys must be kept strictly readable only by the owner (chmod 600)
- SSH key authentication is more secure and scalable than password‑based login.
